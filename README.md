# 🧠 Brain Signal Decoding using Machine Learning & CNNs

## Overview
This project explores how the brain encodes visual sensory information by modeling the relationship between visual stimuli and recorded neural responses. Brain activity measured during visual stimulation experiments was analyzed and decoded using machine learning techniques.

## Methods
- Generalized Linear Models (GLM)
- Logistic Regression
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented in TensorFlow

Classical models provide interpretability, while CNNs capture complex nonlinear patterns in neural signals.

## Results
CNNs were able to model complex brain activity patterns and achieved competitive decoding performance. Model accuracy varied depending on the brain region analyzed, highlighting the importance of data characteristics and preprocessing.

## Technologies
Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib

## Applications
This work demonstrates the potential of machine learning for neural decoding, brain-computer interfaces (BCI), and understanding neural encoding of sensory stimuli.
